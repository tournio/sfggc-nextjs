# Golden Gate Classic website

This is the informational website for the Golden Gate Classic, an IGBO-affiliated bowling tournament. The site is available at [www.goldengateclassic.org](http://www.goldengateclassic.org).

It's built as a static website using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework and [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

It uses Bootstrap 5, and I started the design with mobile viewports, then adapted them for medium and large ones. Since two out of every three visitors is on a mobile device, it seemed like the best approach.

## Learning

I have also used this project to further my understanding of Bootstrap's implementation of color modes, and how Sass works vs. CSS variables. It's very cool stuff, and as someone coming from the backend world of software development, it's been fun to see how it all ties together.
