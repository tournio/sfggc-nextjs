# Golden Gate Classic website

This is the informational website for the Golden Gate Classic, an IGBO-affiliated bowling tournament. The site is available at [www.goldengateclassic.org](http://www.goldengateclassic.org).

It's built as a static website using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework and [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

It uses Bootstrap 4, so it's built for mobile-first.
